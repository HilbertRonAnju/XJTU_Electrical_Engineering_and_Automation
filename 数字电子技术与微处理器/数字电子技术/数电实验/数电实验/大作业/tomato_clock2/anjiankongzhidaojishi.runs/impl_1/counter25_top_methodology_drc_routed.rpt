LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u4/nstate_reg[1]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U1/nstate_reg[0]_C/CLR, U1/nstate_reg[0]_LDC/CLR, U1/nstate_reg[1]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
